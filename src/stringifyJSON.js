// this is what you would do if you liked things to be easy:
// var stringifyJSON = JSON.stringify;

// but you don't so you're going to write it from scratch:

var stringifyJSON = function(obj) {
  // your code goes here
  // Number, String, Boolean, Array, 
  // Objects, null, NaN, undefined, Date, Function
  
};
